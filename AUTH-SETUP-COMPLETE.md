# 🔐 NoshNurture Authentication Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Updated

### 1. **All Pages Now Use Real User Authentication**
   - ✅ Dashboard - Shows only YOUR ingredients
   - ✅ Scanner - Saves scanned items to YOUR account
   - ✅ Recipes - Gets suggestions based on YOUR inventory
   - ✅ Inventory - Displays only YOUR items
   - ✅ Recipe Detail - Uses YOUR ingredients when cooking

### 2. **Authentication Methods**
   - ✅ **Google OAuth** - Sign in with Google (WORKING!)
   - ✅ **Email/Password Sign Up** - Create account with email
   - ✅ **Email/Password Sign In** - Login with credentials

### 3. **Multi-User Support**
   Each user now has their own separate:
   - Inventory items
   - Scanned products
   - Recipe history
   - Personal data

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (IMPORTANT!)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
You need to run this SQL in your **Supabase SQL Editor** to enable Row Level Security:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/baokvmahvfdsexpmasvz/sql/new
2. Copy the contents of `database-migration-auth.sql`
3. Paste and run it
4. This will:
   - Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Create policies so users only see their own data
   - Remove the demo-user default value

### Step 2: Test with Multiple Users
1. Sign in with your Google account (already tested ✅)
2. Scan some groceries
3. Sign out
4. Sign in with a different account (email/password or different Google)
5. Verify you see DIFFERENT data for each user

## 📝 How It Works Now

### Sign Up (New Users)
```
1. User clicks "Sign Up"
2. Enters: Name, Email, Password
3. Supabase creates account automatically
4. User is logged in immediately
5. Redirected to Dashboard
6. All scanned items saved with their user ID
```

### Sign In (Existing Users)
```
1. User clicks "Sign In"
2. Enters: Email, Password OR clicks Google
3. Supabase authenticates
4. User is logged in
5. Dashboard shows ONLY their inventory
6. Recipes use ONLY their ingredients
```

### Google OAuth Flow
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google popup appears
3. User selects account
4. Google authenticates
5. Redirected back to app
6. User is logged in
7. If first time: Account created automatically
8. If returning: Access to existing data
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (After Migration)
- Users can **ONLY see** their own data
- Users can **ONLY modify** their own data
- Database enforces this at the lowest level
- Even if someone hacks the frontend, they can't access other users' data

### Authentication State
- Protected routes redirect to `/auth` if not logged in
- `/auth` page redirects to `/dashboard` if already logged in
- Session persists across page refreshes
- Automatic sign-out when session expires

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration SQL
- [ ] Sign in with Google (already working!)
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with email/password
- [ ] Scan groceries (should save with your user ID)
- [ ] Check Dashboard (should show only your items)
- [ ] Get recipe suggestions (should use only your ingredients)
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Sign in with different account
- [ ] Verify data separation (different users = different data)

## 🎯 What Changed in Code

### Files Updated:
1. `src/components/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Uses `user.id` from AuthContext
2. `src/app/scanner/page.tsx` - Saves items with authenticated user ID
3. `src/app/api/recipes/suggestions/route.ts` - Fetches user's inventory
4. `src/app/recipes/[id]/page.tsx` - Checks user's ingredients
5. `src/app/inventory/page.tsx` - Displays user's items only
6. `database-schema.sql` - Removed demo-user default
7. `database-migration-auth.sql` - NEW: RLS policies

### Key Pattern:
```typescript
// OLD (everyone saw same data)
.eq('user_id', 'demo-user')

// NEW (each user sees their own data)
const { user } = useAuth();
.eq('user_id', user.id)
```

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Your authentication is now FULLY FUNCTIONAL! Every user will have their own separate experience with their own data.

**Important**: Don't forget to run the database migration SQL to enable Row Level Security!

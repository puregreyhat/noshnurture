## How It Works

**Development (Localhost):**
1. User selects language
2. App calls `translateText()`
3. Connected to local Ollama
4. Returns instant translation
5. Displays in selected language

**Production (Vercel):**
1. User selects language
2. App calls `translateText()`
3. Detects it's production
4. Uses browser's Translation API
5. Falls back to English if needed

---

## No Configuration Needed

Your `.env.local` already has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

Vercel automatically:
- Detects it's development-only
- Uses browser API instead
- No changes needed!

---

## Test Checklist

Before pushing:
```bash
npm run build        # ✅ Should pass
npm run dev          # ✅ Should run
# Test recipe translation locally
```

After deploying to Vercel:
- ✅ Open Vercel URL
- ✅ Test recipe page
- ✅ Change language
- ✅ Works!

# Recipe Sorting & Cuisine Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Implemented intelligent recipe sorting by ingredient match count and added cuisine-based filtering to the Recipe Suggestions section of the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Recipe Types** (`src/lib/recipes/templates.ts`)

Added new fields to `RecipeSuggestion` type:
- `cuisine?: string` - The cuisine type (e.g., "Indian", "Italian", "East Asian")
- `matchedIngredientCount?: number` - Number of ingredients user has
- `totalIngredientCount?: number` - Total ingredients needed for the recipe

**Cuisine Assignments:**
- **Indian**: Curry recipes
- **East Asian**: Stir-fry, Fried rice
- **Italian**: Pasta
- **European**: Roasted veg traybake
- **International**: Omelet, Salad, Soup, Wrap/Sandwich, Smoothie

### 2. **Smart Recipe Sorting** (`src/lib/recipes/generator.ts`)

Updated `generateSuggestions()` function with multi-tier sorting:

**Sort Priority:**
1. **Matched Ingredient Count** (Descending) - Recipes using more of your ingredients come first
2. **Score** (Descending) - Secondary priority: recipes using expiring items ranked higher
3. **Total Time** (Ascending) - Tertiary priority: quicker recipes preferred

```typescript
candidates.sort((a, b) => {
  // 1. Sort by matched ingredient count (desc)
  const matchedCountDiff = (b.matchedIngredientCount || 0) - (a.matchedIngredientCount || 0);
  if (matchedCountDiff !== 0) return matchedCountDiff;
  
  // 2. Then by score (desc) - expiring items prioritized
  const scoreDiff = b.score - a.score;
  if (scoreDiff !== 0) return scoreDiff;
  
  // 3. Finally by time (asc) - quicker recipes first
  return a.totalTime - b.totalTime;
});
```

**Example Sorting:**
- Recipe A: 8/10 ingredients match, score 12, 25 min
- Recipe B: 6/10 ingredients match, score 15, 20 min
- Recipe C: 8/10 ingredients match, score 8, 30 min

**Result:** A → C → B (A has most matches, then C with same match count but comes before B due to score)

### 3. **Cuisine Filtering UI** (`src/components/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

#### Added State:
```typescript
const [selectedCuisines, setSelectedCuisines] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

#### Filter Implementation:
- **Available Cuisines**: Indian, East Asian, Italian, European, International
- **Selection Method**: Click to toggle cuisine (multi-select enabled)
- **Default Behavior**: No cuisine selected = show all recipes
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected cuisines highlighted in orange

#### Filter UI Components:
```
┌─ Cuisine Filter Buttons ─────────────────────┐
│ [Indian] [East Asian] [Italian] [European] [International] │
│ (Selected = orange, Unselected = gray)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. **Enhanced Recipe Card Display**

Updated recipe cards to show:
- **Ingredient Match Badge**: Shows "8/10 ingredients" instead of just "Matched"
- **Cuisine Tag**: Displays cuisine type on the recipe card
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows recipes matching selected cuisines

## User Experience Flow

### Before
```
User sees:
- All recipes in random/score order
- No way to filter by cuisine
- No visibility into ingredient matching
```

### After
```
User sees:
1. Recipes sorted by ingredient availability (best first)
2. Filter buttons for cuisine selection
3. Ingredient match count (e.g., "5/8 ingredients")
4. Click filters to show only specific cuisines
5. Can multi-select cuisines (e.g., "Show me Indian AND South Indian")
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Maharashtrian User
**Setup**: User wants only Maharashtrian/Indian recipes

**Action**: 
1. Click "Indian" filter button

**Result**: 
- Only Indian cuisine recipes displayed
- Still sorted by ingredient availability
- Can see which recipes need fewer additional ingredients

### Scenario 2: Mixed Preference
**Setup**: User loves both South Indian and Maharashtrian

**Action**:
1. Click "Indian" filter
2. Click "East Asian" filter

**Result**:
- Shows both Indian and East Asian recipes
- Ranked by how many ingredients user has
- User can prepare any recipe without going shopping

### Scenario 3: Maximum Match Recipes
**Setup**: User wants recipes they can prepare immediately

**Result**:
- First recipe will have the most ingredients user already has
- No need to filter - top recipe is most practical
- Saves time and money

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
All new fields are properly typed with TypeScript strict mode enabled:
```typescript
export type RecipeSuggestion = {
  // ... existing fields
  cuisine?: string;
  matchedIngredientCount?: number;
  totalIngredientCount?: number;
};
```

### Performance
- Filtering happens client-side (no additional API calls)
- Sorting is O(n log n) with efficient tiered comparison
- UI re-renders only when filter selection changes

### Backward Compatibility
- Old recipe data without new fields still works
- Fallback behavior: shows all recipes if new fields absent
- Sugran API recipes still display correctly with "Matched" count

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dietary Preferences**: Add vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free filters
2. **Cook Time Ranges**: Filter by "Quick (< 15 min)" vs "Detailed (> 30 min)"
3. **Saved Favorite Cuisines**: Remember user's preferred cuisines
4. **Regional Variations**: Add more cuisines (Thai, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc.)
5. **Allergen Filters**: Exclude recipes with specific allergens
6. **Ingredient Preference**: Allow users to exclude certain ingredients

# Before & After Comparison

## ❌ BEFORE: Single Brand Only

```
Inventory:
├── Everest Pav Bhaji Masala
├── Aashirvaad Salt
└── Tata Butter

Recipe: "Simple Pav Bhaji" (requires: pav bhaji masala, salt, butter)

Result on Recipe Page:
├── pav bhaji masala → ❌ "Low match" (NOT RECOGNIZED)
├── salt → ❌ "Low match" (NOT RECOGNIZED)  
└── butter → ✅ "High match"

Status: 1/3 ingredients (33%) - INCORRECT! ❌
```

### Why it failed:
- Product name "Everest Pav Bhaji Masala" wasn't being stripped of brand name
- Comparison: "everest pav bhaji masala" vs "pav bhaji masala" → distance > 2 → marked as Low match
- Same issue for "Aashirvaad Salt" vs "salt"

## Real-World Scenario

### User's Kitchen (Before)
```
Inventory Items:
1. Everest Pav Bhaji Masala (bought 2 months ago)
2. Suhana Chaat Masala (gift from friend)
3. Aashirvaad Salt (large pack)
4. Tata Salt (backup)
5. Amul Butter

Total Inventory Value: ~₹300

Problem: "Missing ingredients" warnings even though you had everything!
```

### Same Kitchen (After)
```
Inventory Items (Same as above):
1. Everest Pav Bhaji Masala ✅ RECOGNIZED
2. Suhana Chaat Masala ✅ RECOGNIZED
3. Aashirvaad Salt ✅ RECOGNIZED
4. Tata Salt ✅ RECOGNIZED (can use both variants!)
5. Amul Butter ✅ RECOGNIZED

Result: Recipes show accurate inventory ownership!
No false "missing ingredient" warnings!
```

## Code Changes Impact

### Matching Logic Enhancement

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
// Simple substring matching
if (normalized.includes(ingredient.toLowerCase())) {
  // Found it!
}
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
// Multi-stage matching with brand stripping
1. Strip known brand names
2. Check 2-word combinations
3. Apply synonym mappings
4. Use Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
5. Fall back gracefully if no match

Result: Handles "Everest Pav Bhaji Masala" → "pav bhaji masala"
```
